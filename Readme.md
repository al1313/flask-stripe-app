# Flask Stripe AJAX eEcommerce Example [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/shama/gaze.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/shama/gaze) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vtx65w9eg511tgo4)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shama/gaze)

A simple, Flask & AJAX-powered eCommerce web app that uses Stripe to charge products based on what's in a user's a cart. This was an exercise requested from Stripe's interview process, and is freely available to anyone needing to implement Stripe with AJAX/JQuery and Flask.

### Installation

This app requires Python 3+ to run, so install that first

1. Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add your Stripe keys in config.py:

```
stripe_keys = {
    'secret_key': "",
    'publishable_key': ""
}
```

3. Run:

```python
python manage.py
```
